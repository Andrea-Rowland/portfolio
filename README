# Portfolio

## Purpose

This portfolio was created to showcase the work I've done related to developing. As I gain more experience, I plan to update the "My Work" to reflect the new skills I'm learning. 

The header of the page remains fixed in place to ease in navigation. Clicking on the navigation links will cause the page to scroll to the corresponding section. When the user scrolls to  "My Work", they are able to click on the image of the application and are taken to the deployed application. The site has been designed to be easily viewable on differenct size screens and devices.

Thanks for taking a look at my portfolio!
